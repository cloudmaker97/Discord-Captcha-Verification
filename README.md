# Discord-Verification

This is a simple discord verification bot that uses a captcha (CloudFlare Turnstile).
The bot creates an embed in a specified discord channel with a button. If the button is clicked, the user receives a personal link.
After clicking the link, the user is redirected to the captcha page. If the captcha is solved, the user is verified and receives a role.
The bot also logs the user's IP address and the time of verification.
